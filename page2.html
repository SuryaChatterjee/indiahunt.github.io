    <p>Condemning Vladimir Putin's 'war of choice' in Ukraine, the White House commended the US and 'global companies' for having pulled an 'unprecedented' rejection.Condemning Vladimir Putin's 'war of choice', on Saturday the White House commended the US government and 'global companies' for having pulled an 'unprecedented' rejection of Moscow. In the wake of the Russia-led invasion of Ukraine, the Joe Biden-led country called out on the 'Russian Governmentâ€™s efforts to undermine the free press and spread disinformation'.

        The White House's statement holds relevance as Putin introduced a new law that threatens a jail term of up to 15 years for publishing what the Kremlin deems as 'fake news'. Also, the Russian President implied that the international sanctions on Russia are equivalent to war as his military resumed 'military offensives' in Mariupol despite an agreement on a ceasefire for the human corridor. </p>
