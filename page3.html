    While the world’s attention has been focused on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the instability in the wider region, South Korea’s presidential elections are set to be held on March 9. Early voting began on Friday morning and the election process comes at a time when the country is facing one of its worst waves of the coronavirus pandemic pushed by the Omicron variant.So severe is the pandemic in the country that South Korea revised election law last month to accommodate infected voters so that they could cast their votes, with the voters and booth officials using protective wear and sanitisers. This also comes at a time when the election race is tight with the candidates from the ruling and the opposition parties fighting neck to neck. But these campaigns have not just been defined by the havoc that rising Covid-19 infections have caused, but also how the campaign has focused more on highlighting the flaws and many scandals of the nominees.</p>
